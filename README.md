## This Weather App Project Made Using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. 

> [!NOTE]
> This app is not meant for any commercial use by any means and is built for educational and learning purposes only.
> 
> The weather report is fetched from [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) which delivers proper data most of the time but may posses some "incorrect" data
> at times. Long story short it's not 100% accurate.
>
> The API key for this project is a temporary key and hence might not work in the future.<br />
> [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) provides free API keys upon account creation and can be used if needed for permanent use.

The Search Option uses a JS array to add location suggestion based on the input which speeds up the search process for the API and also opens a drop down menu to choose from. This search option is not the best in the implementation of 
search result optimization and filtering but does the basic job well.

Additional Credits: [@itsdstar](https://github.com/itsdstar) - For making significant changes to css file and also adding a suggestion drop down filter and other functionality for faster api responses.
