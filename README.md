## This Weather App project made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. 

This app is not meant for any commercial use by any means and is built for educational and learning purposes only.

The weather report is fetched from [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) which delivers proper data most of the time but may posses some "incorrect" data at times. Long story short its not 100% accurate !

The Search Option uses a js array to add location suggestion based on the input which speeds up the search process for the api and also opens a drop down menu to choose from. This search option is not the best in the implementation of 
search result optimization and filtering but does the basic job well !

The API key for this project is a temporary key and hence might not work in the future. [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) provides free api keys upon account creation and can be used if needed for permanent use !

Additional Credits: [@itsdstar](https://github.com/itsdstar) - For making significant changes to css file and also adding a suggestion drop down filter and other functionality for faster api responses !
